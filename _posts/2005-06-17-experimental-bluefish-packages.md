I provide bluefish packages made from CVS, which contain the latest features. If you want to test the latest bluefish version, then you can install the [`bluefish-cvs`](apt+http://debian.wgdd.de?package=bluefish-cvs?dist=experimental?section=main) package in additon to a stable `bluefish` Debian package. Both packages use their own files and directories, so you can do relaxed testing of the latest features. Please note, that the development version may not be stable and crash. The packages are located in the **experimental** tree of my [Debian package repository](http://debian.wgdd.de/debian/).
