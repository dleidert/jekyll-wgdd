I provide bluefish packages made from <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>, which contain the latest features. If you want to test the latest bluefish version, then you can install the [bluefish-cvs](http://debian.wgdd.de?package=bluefish-cvs?dist=experimental?section=main) package in additon to a stable bluefish Debian package. Both packages use their own files and directories, so you can do relaxed testing of the latest features. Please note, that the development version is maybe not stable and may crash at every moment. The packages are located in the **experimental** tree of my [Debian package repository](http://debian.wgdd.de/debian/).
